# What I'm up to now

Moved to Barcelona, to start my Masters in Design Management, at IED Barcelona. 

Learning about cool topics such as Design Research, Hybrid Thinking, Sustainable Design, and more.

Trying to allocate more time to learning about cool things like [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and Jekyll -- which I used to develop this [small site](https://mvigo.github.io/SiteInfo/)!  

When my activities change, Iâ€™ll update this page.
