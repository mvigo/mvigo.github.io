<H2> What I'm up to now </H2>

<p> Moved from Barcelona to Geneva, Switzerland, to start an internship at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. I'm based in IdeaSquare, CERN's experimental innovation lab. Enjoying meeting the diverse minds that come to this place, and trying new approaches to design. </p>

<p>When my activities change, Iâ€™ll update this page.
