        <p>On August 8, 2022, during a Rise For The River Benefit concert aimed at supporting those affected by damaging floods in Montana, Mayer revealed the hidden meaning behind the clock featured on the album cover. The clock, set to <b>10:38<b/>, held personal significance to him due to his "obsession with time" and contemplation of his place in life. Mayer explained that if the average male life expectancy was a 24-hour day, then at the time he released the album, it was <b>10:38 AM in the entire day of his life.</b> That was years ago, now, that day in August in Montana it was "about lunch time" in his life. He encouraged others to reflect on the time of day in their own lives as a source of inspiration.[23][24]</p>
