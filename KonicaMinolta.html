<h2> <strong>The Future of Meetings</strong> </h2>

<br>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>Konica Minolta’s UK Business Innovation Center asked us to look into the design principles that would shape the future of meetings.</p>


<h2>My Role</h2>
	
<p>I was part of a 3-person team that covered all as- pects of the design research process, including carrying out trends and user research, insight mapping, ideation, co-creation, and prototyping. </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<h2>The Results</h2>
<p> We delivered a set of guiding design principles to be used in Konica Minolta’s new workplace hub platform. Through these design principles we envisioned a concept for the future of collaborative meetings, that involved developing sensing and projection technologies. A video prototyped showed the potential for new kinds of interaction and collaboration.
We presented our research to Konica Minolta’s Buisiness Innovation Center - London. </p>
