<strong>The Future of Meetings</strong>


<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>Konica Minolta’s UK Business Innovation Center asked us to look into the design principles that would shape the future of meetings.</p>



<h2>My Role</h2>
	
<p>I was part of a 3-person team that covered all as- pects of the design research process, including carrying out trends and user research, insight mapping, ideation, co-creation, and prototyping. </p>

<h2>The Results</h2>
<p> We delivered a set of guiding design principles to be used in Konica Minolta’s new workplace hub platform. Through these design principles we envisioned a concept for the future of collaborative meetings, that involved developing sensing and projection technologies, that have the power for new kinds of interactions and collaborations.
We presented our research to Konica Minolta’s Buisiness Innovation Center - London. </p>
