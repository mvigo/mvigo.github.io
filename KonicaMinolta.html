<h2> <strong>The Future of Meetings</strong> </h2>

<br>

<h2>The Client</h2>
Konica Minolta Buisiness Innovation Center - London.

<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>Konica Minolta’s UK Business Innovation Center asked us to look into the design principles that would shape the future of meetings. Our goal was to lay the groundwork to establish a set of design principles for improving the meeting experience. Through these design principles we envisioned a concept for the future of collaborative meetings, that involved developing sensing and projection technologies, that have the power for new kinds of interactions and collaborations. 
</p>


<h2>My Role</h2>
	
<p>I was part of a 3-person team that covered all aspects of the design research process: trends and user research, insight mapping, ideation, co-creation, and prototyping. </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p> In our aim to establish a set of design principles for improving the meeting experience, we employed several research, ideation, and prototyping tools. 

Our research focused on three main categories: trends investigation, user research, and co-creation sessions. From the research, we built several insights and design principles. </p>

<h2>The Results</h2>
<p> We delivered a set of guiding design principles to be used in Konica Minolta’s new workplace hub platform. Through these design principles we envisioned a concept for the future of collaborative meetings that involved developing sensing and projection technologies, leveraging existing Konica Minolta research and development. A video prototyped showed the potential for new kinds of interaction and collaboration. </p>
