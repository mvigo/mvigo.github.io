This site was developed with <strong>[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) </strong> an open-source site generator.

This site is based on <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a>, and is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Hyde is built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), and was authored by [@MDO](https://github.com/mdo)

This site was assembled with care in Lima, Peru, by yours truly. Big thanks to <a href="https://sivers.org">Derek Sivers</a> for sharing his insights, and motivating me to finally build my own site.




### What's Jekyll? 

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown">the project&#39;s readme</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p>
