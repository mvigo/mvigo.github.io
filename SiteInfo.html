<p>This site is a playground for different learning experiments. Parts of the site were developed with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com"target="_blank">Jekyll</a> 

 an open-source site generator. Others have bits of Bootstrap. </p>

<p> This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com"target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. </p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://sivers.org"target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> for sharing his insights, and motivating me to finally build my own site. </p>

<p> That cool halftone effect on the image was written by <a href="http://breathing-halftone.desandro.com/"target="_blank">Desandro</a>.</p>

<p>The homepage coding and halftone inorporation came straight from <a href="https://twitter.com/tealtan"target="_blank">Allen Tan's page</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p>
