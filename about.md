title: About Me
---

At university I pursued a degree in international relations and philosophy. After graduating my passion for writing led me to a year-long collaboration with The Rockefeller Foundation, where I was focused on researching informal economies. During this project, I was able to see first-hand the power of design thinking and co-creation to generate real and impactful change in the globe.

I then spent over 4 years working in digital marketing, web design strategies, and user experience, as a marketing manager. It was here that I learned to lead innovation projects within a business context, and strengthened my belief that I wanted to keep developing my skills in this field. This led me to pursue a Masters in Design Management at IED Barcelona.

I am curious about <strong>design</strong> in its most abstract form, and how it can improve peoples lives and experiences. Today my aim is not only to apply these innovation processes, but to be an ambassador for the benefits of using these methodologies among groups and people that may not know them. Through this journey I have been fortunate to live and work on 4 continents, and appreciate the value of working with multidisciplinary and cross-cultural teams to achieve meaningful impact.

<h4>Other Tidbits</h4>

I'm a huge music nerd, and during my time at college worked at [WRGP RadiateFM](http://wrgp.radio.net/) as a DJ and Jazz Director. 

In 2011, I started [Tacu Tacu Records](https://tacutacu.pe) a small record label, as a way of promoting contemporary Peruvian music. 

In my spare time I enjoy [writing and recording music](https://mvmv.bandcamp.com), finding new music, and learning new things. 

Equal parts Peruvian and American, I currenty live in <del> Lima, Peru.</del> <strong> Barcelona, Spain </strong>

Here's what I'm doing [now.](https://mvigo.github.io/now)

<!-- I love learning about cool things like [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and Jekyll -- which was used to develop this [small site](https://mvigo.github.io/SiteInfo/). 

In the past year my design work has received international recognition, including: 

* <strong>2016 Ibero American Biennial of Design - Official Selection</strong> <br> 
Selected by the Asociación Diseñadores de Madrid [(DIMAD)](http://www.bid-dimad.org/) to represent Peru in the service design category. 

* <strong>PerúDesignNet</strong> <br> 
[PerúDesignNet](http://perudesignnet.com/en/) was an international design and innovation competition that brought together universities, companies and citizens from all over the world, with the aim of using design to promote change and progress within Peru.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
