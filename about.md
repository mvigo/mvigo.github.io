title: About Me
---

At university I pursued a degree in international relations and philosophy. After graduating my passion for writing led me to a year-long collaboration with The Rockefeller Foundation, where I was focused on researching informal economies. During this project, I was able to see first-hand the power of design thinking and co-creation to generate real and impactful change in the globe.

I then spent over 4 years working in digital marketing, web design strategies, and user experience, as a marketing manager. It was here that I learned to lead innovation projects within a business context, and strengthened my belief that I wanted to keep developing my skills in this field. This led me to pursue a Masters in Design Management at IED Barcelona.

I am curious about <strong>design</strong> in its most abstract form, and how it can improve peoples lives and experiences. Today my aim is not only to apply these innovation processes, but to be an ambassador for the benefits of using these methodologies among groups and people that may not know them. Through this journey I have been fortunate to live and work on 4 continents, and appreciate the value of working with multidisciplinary and cross-cultural teams to achieve meaningful impact.
