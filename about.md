title: About Me
---

I am a marketer and strategic designer by profession. I have over 7 years of experience in content, marketing, and web design strategies. I've also worked as a journalist -- you can read some of my writing [here](https://mvigo.github.io/published/). I have a BA in International Relations and Philosophy from [Florida International University.](http://www.fiu.edu/) Currently I'm studying a Masters in Design Management at IED Barcelona. 

I am curious about <strong>design</strong> in its most abstract form, and how it can improve peoples lives and experiences.

I'm a huge music nerd, and previously worked at [WRGP RadiateFM](http://wrgp.radio.net/) as a DJ and Jazz Director. 

In 2011, I started [Tacu Tacu Records](https://tacutacu.pe) a small record label, as a way of promoting contemporary Peruvian music.

I'm curious about art, design, tech, urban policy, and the intersection of all these things.

In my spare time I enjoy [writing and recording music](https://mvmv.bandcamp.com), finding new music, and learning new things. 

Equal parts Peruvian and American, I currenty live in <del> Lima, Peru.</del> <strong> Barcelona, Spain </strong>

Here's what I'm doing [now.](https://mvigo.github.io/now)

<!-- I love learning about cool things like [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and Jekyll -- which was used to develop this [small site](https://mvigo.github.io/SiteInfo/). 

In the past year my design work has received international recognition, including: 

* <strong>2016 Ibero American Biennial of Design - Official Selection</strong> <br> 
Selected by the Asociación Diseñadores de Madrid [(DIMAD)](http://www.bid-dimad.org/) to represent Peru in the service design category. 

* <strong>PerúDesignNet</strong> <br> 
[PerúDesignNet](http://perudesignnet.com/en/) was an international design and innovation competition that brought together universities, companies and citizens from all over the world, with the aim of using design to promote change and progress within Peru.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
